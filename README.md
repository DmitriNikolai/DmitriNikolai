I'm Dmitri,  I like coding and music. 
I mostly have every social media which are all named Dmitri_Nikolai so you can contact me there.
I am currently learning c# for game development and python for fun. 
  I heard learning different languges can help you learn coding so I started learning python as it looked the simplest of all code.
I work on making 3D models and little minigames to help me with making bigger ones.
I use Unity.
